# Data-Forecasting
Project on stock data forecasting using ARMA model
A project which use ARMA prediction model for stock price prediction  
=========

#Steps to implement the project:

1. I use alpha vantage for fetching real time stock data. I have provided the api key but you can also get your own key at                    https://www.alphavantage.co/                                                        
2. Install missing packages - e.g.    install.packages("forecast")
3. Run (Data fetching and preprocessing.R) for Fetching data and preprocessing 
4. Run forecast.R to make the forecasting model
5. Run "plot between predicted and actual.R" to plot graph between actual and predicted value

Disclaimer: The code for this project was built for the "Machine Learning and Applications" course at CDAC MOHALI in 2018 and was not intended for publication - however, you can use this script as a starting point to built your own project, but please go over the code for obvious improvements and cleanups first.

Please share your finished project with me via akm.anujmehta0011@gmail.com - or not, it's up to you!
